See that? That's laminate on bedroom number 2, just one more carpet left to be torn up. Sue reminded me that over the last 8 years or so I've replaced all the carpet in the house with laminate flooring. Well nearly all, there's still that last bedroom to go.


Which in a roundabout way is my excuse for no project this month. It's been so filled with carpet stripping, laminate laying and what not there's no time for anything else.
