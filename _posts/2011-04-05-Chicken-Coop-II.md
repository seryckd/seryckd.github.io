The chicken coop continues on. Three of the main walls are completed and waiting for me to buy the insulation. The walls are double 3/4" plywood with 1 1/2" Styrofoam sandwiched between them. Hopefully that should keep the birds toasty when the snow lays thick all around.

I still can't cut straight lines with a power jigsaw. One of these days I'll have to get a table saw or a circular saw but until then I'll stick to my (t)rusty hand saws and the jigsaw.
