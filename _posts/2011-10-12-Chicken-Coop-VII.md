The big day arrived! The chickens laid their first egg today. And here it is

I'll be honest, it's a little smaller than those you buy from the shop but that's probably down to the breed of the chickens. But the proof is in the eating and it was definitely tasty.

Now that the first one has come I think the other girls might get the message and join the programme.

Looking forward to more!
