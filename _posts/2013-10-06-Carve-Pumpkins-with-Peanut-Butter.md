Now I'm a big fan of carving pumpkins, we do it every year. Since it's always a good idea to switch things up every now and again I was very intrigued when I saw this [whimsical article](http://www.instructables.com/id/Self-Carving-Pumpkin/) about using squirrels to carve pumpkins.

This I had to try.

First I brought a small pumpkin and marked out a quick pattern, nothing too complicated as I'm pretty sure our local wildlife has never carved pumpkins before.

Then small holes were drilled along the lines.

And then the holes where stuffed with peanut butter, which apparently is nature's favourite source of protein.

Hmm, delicious. Let's leave this juicy treat out in the garden and see what happens.

<b>Update after leaving out overnight:</b>

Nothing. Well, some of the peanut butter had gone, but that could just have been the rain. Either that, or our wildlife eats very carefully.


<b>Update Day 4</b>

Nothing. Well, not true, most of the peanut has disappeared but not to things with claws.

<b>Update Day 9</b>

Since most of the peanut butter had vanished by now I thought it was time to refresh it a little. So far we have a few scratches and dents but nothing resembling carving. 
Come on critters, there's only a few weeks to go.

<b>Update Day 10</b>

It rained most of the day. I am beginning to suspect that this carving trick only works with squirrels and we don't have many of those around.
