We've always wanted some raised beds put have always been put off by the cost of materials However, pressure treated (PT) wood has recently change quite a bit and is now suitable for using next to vegetables. These beds are on a slight slope and so the first step was to dig out a level area. Then three of the boards were placed side by side, clamped tightly and screwed together to form a side of the bed.

This part is interesting. Most of the blueberry bushes required very peaty soil but one type was happy with less peat. By placing some boards across the bed two types of soil could be added.

Finally, some thinner board was cut at 45 degrees and added to the top of the beds.
