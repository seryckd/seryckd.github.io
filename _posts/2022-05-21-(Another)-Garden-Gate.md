Thought I was done with garden gates, but there was still one more to go. There is a compost heap at the bottom of the garden that we throw all our food scraps and leaves on too. It turns out this is irritable to our puppy, so we had to block it off with a makeshift barrier over the winter.




Winter has passed, Spring is here and the barrier was becoming a pain to step over.




Time for an upgrade.

The gate is between two 4x4 posts and has 2x4s to mount the fence planks on.

View from the back, seeing the (rather crude) construction of gate and fence.

This gate is meant to keep the dog out of the compost so it has a self closer in case we forget and leave it open.




Let's hope the dog doesn't learn to jump!
