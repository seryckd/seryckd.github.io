Sue likes to grow plants from seeds (annuals, vegetables, etc) but we don't have a lot of bright windows to get sunlight from. What is needed are some grow lights, only the [commercially available ones are quite expensive.](http://www.bustan.ca/product_detail.asp?menuID=4&amp;SID=24&amp;PID=790).

What are much cheaper to buy are plant shelves without lights. I don't remember exactly where this one came from, probably [Canadian Tire](http://www.canadiantire.ca).

Each shelf is separate and rests upon plastic rods. I got worried about the shelves coming loose with the weight of the lights and plants so I put a 3/8" threaded steel rod down one of the verticals. I suspect this is entirely unnecessary but I brought it so in it goes.

It's being given two sets of 24" fluorescent lights with two T8 bulbs each. The cheapest ones I could find where about $30 from Home Depot with the lights being $3 each. Even though that adds up to $70ish for the lights that's still cheaper than buying commercially.

Each light had to be attached differently. The top one was attached to a piece of wood and the whole thing just sits there so it can detached easily. The bottom one uses some metal brackets to hang off a plastic rod. The brackets were made from strips violently cut from some heating vent using a [Dremel](http://www.dremel.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx) with cutting disc.

To protect the bottom light from water spilling from the shelf above I put on a plywood shelf. Depending upon how the growing season goes we may add additional lights and possibly a heating mat.
