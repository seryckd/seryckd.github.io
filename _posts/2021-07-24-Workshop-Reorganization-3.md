There's a tool desk which is very handy.  This picture was taking just after it was built, at the moments its completely full.  I either need less tools or more desks.




Here's a few pictures taken from the door.

It's become a really useful space and much productive than it used to be.




Next on the agenda is a better main desk.  The one I have is just a piece of wood on top of my first work table I had when I was in my 20s.  Still works surprisingly well.
