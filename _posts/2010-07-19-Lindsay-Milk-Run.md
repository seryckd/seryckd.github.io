A little bit off topic but yesterday I completed my first ever 5km run in the Lindsay Milk Run 2010 with a rather nondescript time of 27mins 40secs.

I was really impressed with the race though, it was like a mini professional marathon.  You had the big start (well, 200 people anyway), ran (jogged) around the streets with traffic held up for you, drinking stations and big cheers from the spectators at the finish.  Very entertaining.

[Edit - [Click here](http://www.chiptimeresults.com/results/) and search for 32nd Annual Linsday Milk Run 5km on July 18th 2010 to see the results in their full glory.]

There was also a 10km race - perhaps that should be next years goal :)
