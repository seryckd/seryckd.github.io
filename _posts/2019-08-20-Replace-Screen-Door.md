The door to the sun room literally fell apart during last winter, and there's really not much point in having a screened in room if there's no screen in the door.

What turned a simple job into a bigger job is that the door was a custom size and all the available screen doors were narrower and shorter. Not wanting to make a custom door myself the only other option was to decrease the size of the door space.




First thing to do was to add a frame of 2.x4s. Here's the frame with the new door in place.

Once I was happy with that it was time to cover with plywood, both inside and out. Here's the outside view.

Painting time! I put on two coats of primer and two coats of outdoor paint.

Sharp eyed readers will notice the bottom of the door is far too close to the floor. I only noticed that when the summer humidity came and the door started sticking. Guess I'll have to trim that at some point!
