In my opinion, a door should always know if it is open or closed. I'm not fond of the ones that can't make up their mind. You know the ones, they're left open but then slowly close when you're not looking. Or worse, they close but don't stay shut; leading to a repetitive cycle of open, slow squeak, bang; open, slow squeak, bang ...

Garden shed doors are particularly bad for this sort of behaviour. Here's one that's closed.

And here it is nicely opened and not likely to close at all thanks to the bolt in the bottom right hand corner.

The bolt wasn't long enough to go vertically, so there's a bit of wood cut at the right angle to trap the bolt but let the door swing free.

There's an extra piece of wood under the bolt just to give the screws something to bite into.
