My toy/tool collection increased last month with a 10" drill press for my birthday.  Its a Mastercraft brand so not exactly high end but perfect for what I need.  

Last weekend I got a chance to use it in anger as the couch finally broke under the misuse the kids give it.  It turns out the legs are held on using a slim bit of wood screwed into the frame, so with a bit of 2x4 and the drill press I was able to fix it.  I was pleased but Sue wasn't so much ... she was hoping to get a new one :)
