We love our trailer but compared to others on the site it was lacking that little something that all the other lots had.




It's own shed.

It was 3 days work, which is a bit slow, but my excuse is it was 30C degrees every day and I am not a hot weather person. Luckily my wife reminded me about the trick of putting your t-shirt and hat in water then putting them back on, which was lovely.

In hindsight I think I overdid the base - I mean, it's only a shed.  But I read up on how to do decks so ended up with a mini deck (its 8' by 8' more or less).  And that sucker is level.  It surprised me how level it ended up.  Probably also a mistake, a slight incline is probably better for the rain.

The metal sheds are pretty sturdy when they are finished, but very weak during construction.  Suzanne helped with keeping it together but still had a few mishaps with walls bending in the wind.  Unless you look carefully at the bottom on the walls you wont notice.  Much.

Things I was surprised by




<ul><li>there was more of a slope than I realized, so one side is off the ground by a few inches. That's a magnet for wee beasties to make their home in so I'll have to fill that in before winter. Plus its a step to get the lawnmower over.</li><li>the beams in the deck do not fit snugly into the deck blocks.  They are loose, in fact.  Which meant the deck moved when you stepped on it because I did not put deck blocks in the corner.  I put some shims in to hold it steady but it feels like a hack.</li><li>the darker shed colour was chosen to match the trailer, but it's a metal shed and holds the heat.  A lighter shade would have been better.</li><li>the doors close properly! I never get doors right.</li></ul>
