For when you don't install cables correctly and just poke them through the walls.

The correct way would be to terminate the cable at a wall plate. But since I had a ready made cable that seemed like a lot of effort. So instead I cheated and just poked it through the wall. Which works great, but didn't look that good.

I brought a face plate to cover it, only the hole is too big. I needed something to fill the gap.

Since it was garbage day I had a cat litter box being thrown out. The soft plastic seemed just right to fill the whole. I cut out a piece that would fit and then used a knife (thank you Stanley) to cut the circle into segments. A small hole was cut with scissors in the middle to allow the wire to pass through.

All in all, it worked out quite well.  Still should have done it properly though :)
