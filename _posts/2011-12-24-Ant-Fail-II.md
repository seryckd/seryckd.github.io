After the last ant entry I felt inspired to make just enough changes to get the ants moving. It's still a pretty dumb algorithm but at least it doesn't crash or timeout.

And what do you know, I did ok-ish. The website published the final rankings and I was placed [1,521 our of around 7,900.](http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=6053)Â Now, let's be clear, all that really says is that there were 1500 serious entries in the competition. It was fun though, I'll pop by the website next year and see if they are running another competition.
