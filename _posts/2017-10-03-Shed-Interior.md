What do you do with an empty shed? Fill it up of course! So far we have the bench, some shelves and a tool rack.

For the tool rack, the forks and spades were placed on the floor and arranged tightly together. The height between the two bars and the distance between the hooks was measured from that.

The bench was a good example of working it out as you go. First I put together a frame of 2"x3" with the idea of putting some board on top.

But after looking at it I realized the bottom shelf was going to be tricky to cut out and very difficult to put on. Things would be a lot easier if the bottom supports were on the inside, not the outside.

After changing the bottom support it was much easier to put on the shelves. The bench was going be used so I added a back board to stop rolly things from rolling away and gave it a good sanding with 3 coats of varnish.

Looking good so far.
