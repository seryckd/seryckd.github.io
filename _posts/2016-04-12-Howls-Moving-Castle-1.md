More paper craft! A little bit more ambitious, this one is the castle from Howl's Moving Castle. It's a big project and since I only work on it now and again it's taking a while.

So far I've been working on it for a year ...

Here's some shots of the pieces just cut out.

Skipping ahead, here's the current status. I have most of the body done.
