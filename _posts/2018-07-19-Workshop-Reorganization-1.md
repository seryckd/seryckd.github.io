When we brought the house one of the previous owners had erected a large workshop in the back garden, about the size of a 3 car garage. Of course, the first thing we did when we moved in was to fill it full of old furniture, christmas decs and various tat.




A few years later and we've settled in enough to open the doors and see what we can do with all the mess.




<h3>Kayak Shelving</h3>

First on the list was this shelving in the middle that holds the kayaks, also from the previous owner. So far we've taken them out a few times a year so we'd like to hang on to them.




The trouble with it, is you need the space under the kayaks free and also the space either side of it so can lift them up and down. So with a bit of playing around I rejigged it so both kayaks are on the same side.

Not only do we save space, but it's easier to lift them as well. I'm not the tallest guy in the world so not lifting my hands above me head to pick them up is a bonus.




<h3>Wood Cart</h3>


About 5 years ago I built [a wood cart](https://seryckd.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/wood-cart/) for storing all the scraps of wood that just might come in handy in the future. Well it turns out it was useful and some of that wood did get used. A lot didn't, mind you.

But I cheated out on the casters and brought small 2" ones for the very practical reason I could buy 4 of them for the price of a large 4" castor. Although they worked well enough they were useless for moving the cart as it was just too heavy. So it was time to pony up and just pay for the large wheels ($20 each). Here's a close up of the tiny wheels

and here's the new, larger ones

Just to give an idea of the size difference

and I'm happy to report the new wheels work much better, and the cart has become mobile! Which means I can now wheel it out the way when I need to get a large piece of wood on the tablesaw.
