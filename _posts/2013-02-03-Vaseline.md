Amazing thing, vaseline. It has many uses.

Here's the latest one I just found out - it stops car doors from sticking in cold weather. We've had issues this year with the doors not opening. Just sticking a screwdriver in the gap and forcing it open will work, but it's too easy to scratch the paint or tear the seal. And it takes a while, which is not something you want to be doing in cold weather.

So ... take your handy dandy jar of petroleum based jelly and wipe a generous amount around the door seals. That's it, you're done. No more stuck doors. 

A slight word of caution, you do need to watch out for greasy doors when you open and close them. A small price to pay.
