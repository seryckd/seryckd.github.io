Privacy film is a covering you can get to turn clear windows into opaque windows. Â We had a small window by the front door that the dogs were always barking at people walking past. Here it is covered up with bamboo.

Before that we put it on it was quite see through. If you look at the bottom of the glass you can see all the wet nose marks of the dogs.

It comes in a small package.

You measure the window and use scissors to cut to size.

Oh, clean the glass first.

Then its just a spray of water and a rubber scraper to push out the bubbles as the film goes on. Just like the cover on a mobile phone.
