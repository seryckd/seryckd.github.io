Adding grip handles to a kids jigsaw

Helped out our daughter at the weekend with a school project. She wanted to add some knobs to a jigsaw to make it easier for young kids to grab. I had some dowel spare, so we used that. It was too small to use a power tool to cut, so I went with the [mitre box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitre_box)Â and a [Japanese pull saw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_saw). Still took a while to make 24 cuts.

Since it was meant for young kids I also sanded down each edge a little.

Test fitting

Fixed them to the jigsaw with a small finishing nail and a drop of wood glue.

I call it The Pincushion.
