Ok, this is getting to be a habit, but here's another thing that's been complete for a few weeks before I get around to putting the pictures up.

The playpen for the chickens is done and up. Without further intro -

Confession time, this is not a good one. The wood is untreated and resting on bare ground because everything was done in a rush before we went on vacation. Not that the chickens mind, they're just happy to get out of the coop.
