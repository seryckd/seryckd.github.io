Here's the finished bedroom renovation in glorious technicolour. I'd like to show what it looked before but of course I forgot to take pictures.

We did the following
<ul>
<li>removed the old phone wiring along the baseboards, along with all the old paint build up, scraped it down and repainted.</li>
<li>got a professional in to put a fresh layer of plaster on a few of the walls that were looking bad.</li>
<li>new closet doors</li>
<li>cleaned all the old paint from the door handles, mortise lock and hinges</li>
<li>crown molding</li>
<li>painted all trim and walls</li>
<li>new bedroom furniture</li>
<li>cushions (apparently it's a thing)</li>
</ul>

The other thing worth calling out is the air duct. It's metal and was covered in layers of white paint so it blended in with the baseboard. As we were cleaning it up we thought it might be interesting to spray it a bronze colour. I think it worked rather well, we'll be doing the same in the other upstairs rooms when we renovate those too.
