After all the excitement last winter on making the hypertufa it's time for an update on how they're doing. Here a few of them after being planted and left out for the summer season.

Now of course you spotted the fake - the one on the right is a shop brought one. Apart from the colour difference they've done very well. No cracks, and the plants definitely still alive.

Also, they look pretty good.
