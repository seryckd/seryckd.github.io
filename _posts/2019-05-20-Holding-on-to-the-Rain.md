Water is always needed in a garden and its better to capture it then to use it from the tap. We got some water barrels last year and have been holding on  to them until I got a chance to properly set them up.




I used some 4"x4" pressure treated wood to make a table for holding four barrels and placed it on some old paving stones. The top of the table was made from 1"x6" decking.

The barrels were placed on top with small pavers inside to way them down until they filled up with rain.

After this was taken I switched them around so that all the tallest ones were on the right, and the shortest on the left.




The back of the barrels are joined by black accordion tubes through the overflow holes so they should all fill up together. The last barrel has an actual overflow (not shown).
