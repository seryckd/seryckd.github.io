We got a second hand camera (Nikon D60) with a remote control (fancy). I just had to try that out so did a quick stop frame animation with some [Dr Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw) figures.

There were definitely some mistakes made. For one, the pictures were shot at 10 mega pixels but converted to video using [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) at 640x400 so it ends up looking a bit murky. Next time I'll keep it at a much higher res until the final video conversion. Also, I used a frame rate of 20 pictures per second which made the whole thing look a bit like a [Benny Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Benny_Hill_Show) skit.

One the stills were converted to video I used [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/ca/ilife/imovie/) to splice it all together, mainly because it was the only video I had.

Oh, the 'special effects' were done with [The Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/). This has what is a strong contender for Worst User Interface and the learning curve is steep. However, it has two redeeming features - it is powerful and it is free.

Anyways the final product looked like this :

The second Dalek is supposed to be destroyed by the first only I had deleted the original frames so couldn't put the effect in. (Lack of space on the hard drive is a terrible thing.)
