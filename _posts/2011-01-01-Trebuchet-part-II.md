Ok, winter is here and so it's time to shake down the trebuchet. Also, I have a shiny drill press now so I can put 90 degree holes in the wood and not 92 degree ones which is what I was getting with the hand drill.

No major changes, just stripped down, redrilled and a new case for the weight so that it swings freely instead of hitting the bottom.

It swings really nicely now. Just for a test I threw some snowballs with it.
