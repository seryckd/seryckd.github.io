Here's an arch we got a few years ago.  It went up quickly and was just held in with some garden posts and a few chunks of wood. Our dog decided the wood looked pretty tasty and ran off with it, and the arch fell down pretty soon after wards.




So it was time to do the job properly, and here it is all backup again.

The ground slopes, and there's a good 4" difference between each side, so I wanted to use some concrete posts to level it up. Once they go in, they're not being moved so it's really important to get it right. I thought I would go with template that that could be used to hold the posts in place.

Its a piece of plywood with circular corners. It was handy for levelling the cardboard tubes as well.  It eded working quite well.
