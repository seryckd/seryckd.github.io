And just like that, the seasons rolled, time passed and nothing was added to the blog.

It's not that things didn't happen, it's just that they weren't photographed, or catalogued, or sorted out into blog entries. Sue was busy getting new qualifications which meant more of the household chores for me; also I started working more at home, which means a blurring of when work stops and blog time begins.

Plus we moved house in around August. Which was busy. But on the plus side there are loads of new projects to do and some that have even been completed.

Let's call the last year a break and get back to the hurly burly of constant once a month blogging. Can you get more frenzied than that?
