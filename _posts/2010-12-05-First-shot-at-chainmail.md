Here's my first attempt at chainmail using some wire I had left over from tying the raspberry canes back. It's conceptually very easy to do (twist wire around a cylinder, cut and use pliers to link) but surprisingly fiddly to get all the rings in the pattern they're supposed to be in.

Based upon this experience I may consider doing a headpiece but never a shirt. One website quoted approximately 10,000 rings for that. er, no thanks.

There are plenty of sites for this on the 'net, this is a particularly good one: [art of chainmail](http://artofchainmail.com/patterns/index.html)
