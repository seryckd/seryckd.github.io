A few years ago we built one of those garden sheds from a box. It turned out great but I never got around to giving it a proper step.

I used some spare wood to create a form and poured post concrete directly on the gravel foundation. Then I used a wet trowel and had some fun making the top look at smooth as possible.




Turned out alright.
