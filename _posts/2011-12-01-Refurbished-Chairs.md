The dining room chairs were looking a little shabby, they still had the same green coverings on them as when we brought them. Sue brought some red coverings and thought we could spruce them up a bit.

Here's the original chair

We spread the red cloth over and stapled them on - job done.

Not too bad. There were 6, so it took a few evenings and far too many staples. But not too bad.
