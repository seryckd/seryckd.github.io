Here's a picture of two F-Clamps brought at Canadian Tire aprox 5 years apart. Same brand (Mastercraft) and same size (4"x24"). Â But not the same quality.

The one on the right is made of thicker steel, the clamps are much thicker, even the plastic grips are bigger. The one of the left bends slightly, it feels cheap.

In this one the newer clamp is resting on top the of the old one and the differences are stark.

It makes you wonder what else is being sacrificed in order to keep things cheap.
