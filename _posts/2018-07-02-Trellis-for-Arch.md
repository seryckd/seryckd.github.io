Spring has sprung and plants need some new trellis to climb up. Here's the main arch with the finished side trellis in place.

Before the trellis the arch was looking a bit bare for climbing plants.

I wanted to use pressure treated (PT) wood but it doesn't come in 1" and 2" strips. Instead, I brought 6" planks and used a table saw to rip them into the smaller widths.

The 2" strips made the frame and the 1" strips made the trellis part. Of course, I don't have a picture of the horizontal strips.

Then it was just a matter of making two of them and nailing them to the side of the arch.
