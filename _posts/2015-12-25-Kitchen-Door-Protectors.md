This one might not work out, we'll have to see. The kitchen doors in the new house are painted, which means they get dirty finger prints and chipped very easily.

In order to protect the paint I'm trying out this

It's a piece of plastic cut from a soft folder, the ones designed to hold paper with a clear front. I cut out plastic rings like this

Then inserted them behind the handles on the screw

From a distance you can hardly see them. Thicker plastic may work better as you can get your fingers caught on them. But as a cheap measure they definitely help.
