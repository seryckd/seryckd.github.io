A posture arch is a bit of bent wood you lie on to help relieve back pain.  I use one at the gym I go to (it's attached to a physiotherapist so there's lots of odd things lying around).  The only problem is they charge $120 for this piece of bent wood.

Here's the [company that makes](http://posturespecific.com/products-posturearch.asp) them so you can get an idea.

Being a bit cheap I thought I could make one.  So I traced the outline of one onto a piece of paper and used some scraps of wood I had lying around to come up with this :

It's not quite as elegant as the original but it's pretty similar.  I've been using it a few times a week for a month now and it seems to work as well as the posh one.
