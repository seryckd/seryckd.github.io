Time for paper models. I found some plans for three Killa Kans on 4chan and thought I'd give them a go. Here's the data sheet

Now, I haven't done many of these paper models but usually I've seen instructions of some sort. Not this one, you have to work it out. Although you can usually work out where the parts go, the difficulty is knowing when not to cut around the edge so that folded tags can be left.

Anyway, here's the finished model

All in all, not too bad. It would need a wash of paint to cover up the white bits to really look good. It's very fiddly to do, some of the parts are very small.

Just for fun, here's a short video of model doing a twirl
