The boys are big teenagers now and a little on the clumsy side, so it is not always a surprise when something 'accidentally' breaks. Like, for instance, the arm of a chair that was clearly designed for a single person.

The bad news here is that the arm is integral in holding the back on, so in this case the broken arm meant a broken chair.

After a bit of pondering I saw an old metal snow shovel that looked like it could be pressed into service. A hacksaw was used to take off two 1" strips and then the drill press used to match the existing bolt holes in the chair. To be on the safe side I went with 6 screws for each metal strip.

Here's the other side, the plastic arm was also glued with gorilla glue before putting on the strips.

Fully assembled.

Not too bad and holding up so far, cross fingers.
