There's a little (4'x4') bathroom on the ground floor that was looking a little ... unloved.

One day I had some spare filler and just had a go at patching up some of the larger holes and dents. But it was hard to know when a large dent became a smaller dent.

And so I got a larger bucket of filler and just kept going!

Before I knew it, much filler and sanding had occurred, with some undercoating along the way the as well.

Painting was tricky in a small space. I had to make sure to paint the bit of wall I needed to lean on to reach round a corner.

A couple of coats later, a new wall cabinet, light and pictures and the little room was looking much better.

It even got one of Sue's pictures to contemplate on whilst going about your business :)
