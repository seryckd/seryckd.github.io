Sometimes you have good ideas when tidying up. I needed a space to store a membership card that I only used occasionally, and I was worried/knew that putting it in a drawer would cause it to move to the Place that Lost Things go to.




It's a piece of scrap wood with 45 degree angles, lightly sanded and varnished.

Here it is, attached to the wall by the front door with the membership card in. It does exactly what I want it do in a simple way.
