Not a project, but something quite monumental all the same.  A few weeks ago the driveway was paved.  It's gone from messy gravel to shiny tarmac - lovely!

Of course, this time next year it will be mottled grey but for now we shall revel in it's Shinyness.

Footnote:  Son #1 decided it was perfect for skateboarding on, so after a quick 1 minute test he decided he was good to go and promptly wiped out gaining a sizeable set of scrapes in the process.  In case you can't tell from the picture there's quite a slope on that there driveway :)
