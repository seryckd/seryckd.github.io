Automatic kettles are a wonderful thing. You turn them on, they turn themselves off when ready. What more could you ask for?

Sadly, they don't make 'em like they used to. We have had our share of failed kettles, normally around the switch or lid mechanism. So when the current kettle decided that it no longer wanted the lid to stay closed, enough was enough.

Upon investigation it could be seen that a spring had worked its way loose and was no longer pushing back on a piece of plastic that should have kept the lid in place.

That wasn't too much of a surprise since it was only a few months ago that the same thing happened. This is how the spring should be.

I could have just put the lid back together but clearly the same thing was going to happen again. For a more permanent repair I used some [Sugru](https://sugru.com/about/) to stick the end of the spring down.

We'll see how that does.
