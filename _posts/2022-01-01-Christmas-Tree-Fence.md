It's our puppy's first Christmas and there is so much for her to see, do and chew. After finding tree ornaments around the house it was time to restrict some of the temptations.

This was a quick project, completed in one day.

The fence is made of 3 identical panels made from 6 posts of 2x3x1. Cut some wood to use as spacers to ensure that all the posts are spaced evenly.

The feet are made from 2x4. Used a table saw to cut the groove and a chisel to tidy up. Used a chop saw to put some 'decorative' corners on them.

One of the panels assembled. The feet are pushed on and held with friction. Well, some of them are. And some of them fall off because they are too loose.
