My first earthquake.  Nothing special, just a rumbling of the ground, the blinds on the window shaking, one larger shake and then all finished.  It livened up a work day, though.

[This is the link](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010xwa7.php) to the US earthquake page about it.  Magnitude 5.5 outside of Montreal, probably only a 3 by the time it hit me in Toronto.
