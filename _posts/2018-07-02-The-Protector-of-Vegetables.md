After one too many squirrel attacks on unsuspecting seedlings it was time to strike back. Behold, the Protector of Vegetables.

The frames were made with spruce, not pressure treated. Partly because they only need to be out for a few weeks and partly because that's just the wood I happened to have lying around.

They were nailed together with corner braces.

The frames were covered with chicken wire which was stapled down.

They were deployed on the raised bed and successfully stopped the squirrel threat until the seedlings grew to be too large for the frame.
