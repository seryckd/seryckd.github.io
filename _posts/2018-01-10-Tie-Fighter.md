My daughter got me another Metal Earth model for Christmas 2016. Took me a while to get to it, but here it is now, theÂ [Rogue One Tie Striker](https://www.metalmodels3d.com/collections/rogue-one/products/3d-tie-striker).

This one was rather tricky with a lot of small pieces. It's possible my eyesight isn't as good as it once was, but I needed a light and a magnifying glass to get some of the pieces in.
