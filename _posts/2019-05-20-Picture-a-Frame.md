Sue has been working on a number of paintings lately and she wondered if I could make some frames.


After a little research I settled on this design.

The pine was brought to the required size and cut on a mitre saw.

Initially I tried to use clamps and green tape to hold it together whilst it glued. Â This didn't quite work so I went with just clamps.

Here's a test picture in the frame.

In the end I wasn't happy with this design, the frame was too thick. I ended up cutting a thinner frame.
