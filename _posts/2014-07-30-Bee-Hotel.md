This is another one of those projects that came out of Suzanne's garden lectures she goes to. is a buzz phrase at the moment as with all the bee diseases around it behoves us to look after the wee beasties. After all, who else will pollenate the fruit trees?

Specifically it's the mason bees who like to burrow into the dirt who are having a hard time of it. Spare patches of dirt are becoming increasingly rare in our gardens as we throw mulch down and pave over for car parking.

All the mason bees need is a small hole they can seal up. Suggestions around the 'net include drilling holes in wood, using bamboo, other dead plant stems

So here's what we did

All we need to do now is to wait and year and see if anyone moves in.
