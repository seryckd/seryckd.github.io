One of the bedrooms in the house needed a bit of a spruce up. First on the list was a mismatched floorboard added by a contractor after doing some work.

Not very pretty, and ill fitting as well. Luckily we didn't need to find a colour match for the stain as my brother in law had some spare boards from when he did his floor that were a pretty good match.

You can see the two slightly different coloured boards in this picture.

The other boards had been sanded and stained at some point in their life. {% img src="/assets/posts/2016-04-12-Bedroom-Renovation-1/joyce-bedroom-floor_25796492793_o.jpg" url="/assets/posts/2016-04-12-Bedroom-Renovation-1/joyce-bedroom-floor_25796492793_o.jpg" caption="Joyce Bedroom Floor" size="halfsize" alt="Joyce Bedroom Floor" align="center" %}

Also, just to keep things interesting all of the boards are slightly different widths. I just hope we don't have to replace anymore.

Now the floor is fixed, the next step is to put a dividing wall.
