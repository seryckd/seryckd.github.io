Todays task was to fix some wobbly chair legs.  The legs had been worn away and to fix them I went with stuffing slivers of newspaper mixed with wood glue into the crack.  It was also a good excuse to use some new tools I got for Christmas - basically small pointy metal sticks meant for carving but very useful for any jobs that require small point metal sticks.

So far (two weeks) it's been surprisingly effective but I've no idea how long it will last.
