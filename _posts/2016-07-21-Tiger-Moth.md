Fancy something crafty to do for a few hours? There's a few of these kits from [Metal Earth](http://www.fascinations.com/metalearth), which in these parts you can find in most hobby stores.

Basically you get a laser cut sheet of thin steel and a schematic-like set of instructions. You need tools to
<ul>
<li>cut the shapes out - I used a small wire cutter</li>
<li>bend the shapes - I used two small pliers</li>
</ul>
The instructions are mostly clear but you have to be careful on the different signs for bending; there's one for towards you and one for away. Other than that, you find the shape, cut it out and bend it. The shapes go together in a Tab into Slot manner then you usually bend the tab back to keep it together.

Here's the plane about half way through

Repeat for a few hours, less if you don't get interrupted by family wanting dinner and you get something like this

Oh, and the wheels turn around. Nice.
