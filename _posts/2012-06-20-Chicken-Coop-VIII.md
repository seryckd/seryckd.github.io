So time has passed and the chickens have settled in nicely into their pen. Well, as long as you count eating all the grass and stamping the dirt down into a hard surface settling in nicely. Which would be fine in the summer but tended to become a sticky bog in the rains.

Brains were engaged and thoughts were made. The conclusion was made: an extension was necessary. Now, if our dog had not developed a taste for chicken we could let them roam free, which would be ideal. It's a bit of a shame that they do tend be viewed as protein on legs, especially by animals with teeth.

So in the pen they stay.

It was a bit quick and rough but there it is. Functional, I think you'd call it. It's a been a few weeks now and the grass has not disappeared completely so there's definitely a bit more wiggle room for them.
