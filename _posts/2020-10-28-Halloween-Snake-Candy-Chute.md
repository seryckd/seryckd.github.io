It's halloween in 2020 so that means better safe than sorry. So why not make it fun? I like the idea of candy chutes but they look so boring. Here's my take on how to jazz them up a bit.

It was pretty quick and dirty




<ul><li>Cut PVC pipe to length, I went with 4'</li><li>Snip some chicken wire into a rough snake head shape</li><li>Use small amounts of duct tape to attach to the pipe</li><li>Apply paper mâché to get the basic shape</li><li>Put on some details, such as eyes, teeth and brows with some kids modelling clay</li></ul>

If I was doing it again I would not use chicken wire. It's a pain to work with and doesn't give a very organic feel. However, it does bulk out the snake head cheaply without too much expensive clay.




We'll give it a try out this weekend and see how it goes.
