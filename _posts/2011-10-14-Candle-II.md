For thanksgiving I made a candle decoration cast from a kids toy. The composimold was used to take the shape, then a small hole was cut in the bottom for the wick to poke through. I was a bit concerned about wax pouring through the hole so made so there were paper towels and newspaper underneath everything. Then I held the wick (a piece of string) in the air as the hot wax was poured in and used a bit of cardboard placed on top to rest the string on as the wax dried.

Here it is after being lit. It burned quite well in the end.

For something made out of string and cheese wrappers that's not too shabby.
